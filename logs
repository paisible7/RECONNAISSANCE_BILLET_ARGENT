[        ] Caused by: java.lang.RuntimeException: An issue was found when checking AAR
metadata:
[        ]   1.  Dependency 'androidx.activity:activity:1.11.0' requires libraries and
applications that
[        ]       depend on it to compile against version 36 or later of the
[        ]       Android APIs.
[        ]       :app is currently compiled against android-34.
[        ]       Recommended action: Update this project to use a newer compileSdk
[        ]       of at least 36, for example 36.
[        ]       Note that updating a library or application's compileSdk (which
[        ]       allows newer APIs to be used) can be done separately from updating
[        ]       targetSdk (which opts the app in to new runtime behavior) and
[        ]       minSdk (which determines which devices the app can be installed
[        ]       on).
